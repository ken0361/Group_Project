## Reflective discussion  
In general, the project is completed successfully because our idea is proved realistic and the whole system nearly reached our original goal. Even we only have limited feedback from users and the COVID-19 and lockdown make it harder for us to do the test in university library, we still overcome those difficulties and create the final system. During this process, we found that our initial structure was quite reasonable so we need not to change frequently when we proceeded our project. Also most participants express that they were willing to use our product when it is fully implemented, which reveal that our product have potential to put into students’ daily life. 

However, even we think our product can come into use, there are still many limitations. First, currently we are not approved to access to university library database, therefore we can only test our system with 20 books whose label are filled by ourselves. Second, actually we are unfamiliar with the administrators and librarians’ work, the information and function in desktop system is not enough if we want to go further. Last, in our initial scheme, the M5stack can be applied with a camera which can scan the barcode attached in each book. But due to the lack of equipment , we fail to reach this goal.

Overall, our completed project is proved to be feasible and do have the ability to assist students raise the efficiency of finding books, nevertheless when it comes to reality , quite a lot problems are left to be solved. 


## Future work   
As mentioned above, we still have a long way to go if we want to perfect our product. Here is a list of our future work
- collect more feedback when the lockdown is ended.
- Buy a camera and fix it to our M5stack
- Conduct a market survey to see whether product can be accepted by public
- Interview librarian and administrator to add more functions to M5stack and desktop system
- Try to get access to the library database or build a database
- If we can access to the library database, extend the MQTT communication
